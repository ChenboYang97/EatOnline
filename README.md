## Reflection 

This was a side project built during my second year at the University of Southern California. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with the web development workflow.  
   
### Technologies implemented
Backend:
* Spring MVC and Spring Core for backend architecture  
* MySQL for database  
* Hibernate for manipulating database in an OOD way  
* Spring Security for authentication and authorization

Frontend:
* React JS for the frontend architecture
* And Design for the components of the UI
