# EatOnline

A web application used to order foods online, built with Java Spring framework for backend and React for frontend.

## Project status
This project is still in progress...  

Currently, the project has already implemented the main features for a basic online order website including signup, login, selecting restaurants, getting the menu, ordering some foods, and checking out features. For my first Spring project, however, there are still much more places that can be improved, and also I am not actually satisfied with it. Thus, I am still working on the project in my leisure time, not only for the back-end with spring and hibernate, but also for the front-end with react js.

## Reflection 

This was a side project built during my first year at the University of Southern California. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with the web development workflow.  
   
### Technologies used
Backend:
* Spring MVC and Spring Core for backend architecture  
* MySQL for database  
* Hibernate for manipulating database in an OOD way  
* Spring Security for authentication and authorization

Frontend:
* React JS for the frontend architecture
* And Design for the components of the UI
